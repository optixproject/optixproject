        <h2>About OPTIX</h2>
        <p>
            OPTIX (Optimising Positive-Energy Districts through Interoperable Digital Platforms) is a pioneering project that addresses the challenges of urban energy systems through innovative solutions. OPTIX integrates renewable energy technologies, smart control systems, and cutting-edge digital platforms to create and optimize Positive-Energy Districts (PEDs). 
        </p>
        <p>
            At its core, OPTIX develops and validates technologies such as digital twins, blockchain-based energy trading platforms, and AI-driven optimization tools. These solutions ensure the seamless integration of renewable energy sources&mdash;such as solar PV, geothermal systems, and thermal storage&mdash;while enhancing energy flexibility and user participation. 
        </p>
        <p>
            OPTIX features a holistic approach, encompassing technical, societal, and economic dimensions. It prioritizes energy efficiency, reduces carbon emissions, and fosters community empowerment by enabling peer-to-peer energy trading and participatory energy management.
        </p>
        <p>
            The project will demonstrate its solutions through <strong>seven real-world pilot sites</strong> across Europe, representing diverse urban contexts, climates, and regulatory conditions. These pilot demonstrations will validate scalability, replicability, and long-term impacts, ensuring OPTIX's outcomes contribute to achieving the European Green Deal's target of climate neutrality by 2050.
        </p>
        <p>
            By transforming urban districts into active, sustainable energy hubs, OPTIX sets a benchmark for clean energy transition, aligning with the <strong>CETPartnership goals</strong> and supporting broader <strong>Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</strong>, particularly <strong>SDG 7</strong> (Affordable and Clean Energy), <strong>SDG 11</strong> (Sustainable Cities and Communities), and <strong>SDG 13</strong> (Climate Action).
